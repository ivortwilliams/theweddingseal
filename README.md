# The Wedding Seal

A wedding invitation, from a stationery house that does not exist, for a wedding that is not
happening, between Thomas and the mother of his friend Matt.

Live at **https://theweddingseal.com**.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `email/invite.html` | The invitation email. Tables and inline styles only. |
| `public/index.html` | The landing page: the envelope that opens, the invitation, the RSVP form. |
| `server.js` | Serves the page, takes the RSVP, emails it to Thomas via Resend. |

## Why the envelope is on the web and not in the email

Gmail strips `<style>` blocks unreliably, removes all JavaScript, and ignores CSS animation.
An envelope that opens cannot run inside the message. So the email is a static invitation
card with an **Open your invitation** button, and the animation lives on the landing page —
which is exactly what Paperless Post and Greenvelope do, for exactly this reason.

## Deliverability notes

The domain is new, so it has no sending reputation. What we do about that:

- SPF, DKIM and DMARC are all set before the first send.
- Resend's click and open tracking are **off**. Both rewrite links through a tracking
  subdomain, which reads as bulk mail.
- The From address is a person, not `noreply@`.
- Test sends go to the sender's own Gmail first, to confirm inbox placement.

Verified 2026-09-08: the first send landed in the Gmail **inbox**, not spam and not Promotions.

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Sends the RSVP notification. Secret. |
| `NOTIFY_EMAIL` | Where RSVPs land. |
| `NOTIFY_FROM` | From address on the notification. |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` | Guards `/admin`, which lists every response. Secret. |

`/admin?token=…` reads a file on the container's ephemeral disk, so it empties on redeploy.
The notification email is the durable record. The token itself lives only in the App Platform
secret, never in this repo.

## Where it runs

DigitalOcean App Platform app `theweddingseal`, Sydney, `apps-s-1vcpu-0.5gb`, deployed from this
repository. Deliberately a separate app from the `tastyradio` droplet, which also serves
`radio.truthseekersbyo.com` and must not be disturbed.
